<p>Most premium wireless earbuds are not waterproof, and that can be a bummer if you&#8217;re into sweaty workouts or spend hours at the pool. But these are — so feel free to get wet! Not that you&#8217;re planning to dunk them, but these buds can be submerged in up to 3 feet of water and are safe for showering too. That&#8217;s not the case with Samsung Galaxy Buds or AirPods (while the Pros are water-resistant, that&#8217;s not the same as waterproof).</p>

<p>&#8220;These headphones are literally fantastic,&#8221;&nbsp;shared a satisfied shopper. &#8220;I am a professional musician, and these have an incredibly clear sound quality and really high-end parts. The connection is fast and easy, it charges while in the case, which is a great feature &#8230; Really high-end headphones for an amazingly good price.&#8221;</p>

This one — which has tens of thousands of fans — is lightweight and portable, and conveniently folds down into a little pouch for easy carrying.

<p>Treat your tush to the oh-so-refreshing spray of this popular bidet, which allows you to adjust the water pressure to your liking.

<p class="has-drop-cap">What&#8217;s made Amazon shoppers fall in love with Tozos? Superior audio quality, of course, courtesy of 6-millimeter speaker drivers that produce powerful, crystal-clear sound. Trust us, these earbuds sound way better than the past.</p>



<p>Most premium wireless earbuds are not waterproof, and that can be a bummer if you&#8217;re into sweaty workouts or spend hours at the pool. But these are — so feel free to get wet! Not that you&#8217;re planning to dunk them, but these buds can be submerged in up to 3 feet of water and are safe for showering too. That&#8217;s not the case with Samsung Galaxy Buds or AirPods (while the Pros are water-resistant, that&#8217;s not the same as waterproof).</p>
